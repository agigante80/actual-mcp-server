I want you to systematically test all 51 Actual Budget MCP tools available to you. Follow these rules:

**Preflight Assumptions:**
- An Actual Budget file is already open and writable
- MCP server is connected to a single budget (no budget switching required)
- No other concurrent clients are mutating the budget
- Currency is consistent (assume cents-based integer amounts unless specified)
- Dates are interpreted in local budget timezone

**Failure Definition:**
A tool test is considered FAILED if:
- The MCP tool returns an error, exception, or non-OK status
- The response schema is missing required fields
- Returned data contradicts expected effects (e.g., deleted item still listed)
- IDs expected to be returned are null or missing

**Testing Approach:**
1. Test ONE tool at a time, sequentially - DO NOT test multiple tools in parallel unless explicitly requested
2. WAIT for each tool's response before proceeding to the next tool
3. Test tools AUTOMATICALLY one after another - DO NOT STOP - DO NOT wait for user confirmation
4. NEVER ASK if user wants to continue - just continue automatically to the next tool
5. ONLY STOP if a tool fails per the Failure Definition above - report the failure and wait for instructions
6. Start with read-only/safe operations, then move to write operations
7. Use realistic test data with clear naming (include timestamp: 2025-12-16)
8. After each tool test, output exactly one line: [Phase X] tool_name — ✓ success OR [Phase X] tool_name — ✗ failure: <error summary>
9. DO NOT provide explanatory text between tests - just the status line and continue to next tool
10. Continue testing automatically until you hit a failure or complete all 51 tools

**ID Handling Rules:**
- Persist every returned ID immediately after creation
- NEVER assume ordering or auto-selection of IDs
- If an ID is missing, treat as failure
- Explicitly reference stored IDs in all subsequent calls

**Query Constraints:**
- If a query fails due to unsupported SQL features:
  - Report as "Unsupported by query engine" (✓ informational)
  - Do NOT treat as MCP failure

**Safety Rule:**
If a destructive operation would affect non-test data:
- Abort and report ✗ failure immediately

**Testing Order:**

**Phase 1 - Server & Read-Only (5 tools):**
- actual_server_info (expect: server metadata, no error)

- Verify with actual_payees_get (confirm deletion)

**Phase 5 - Rules (4 tools):**
- actual_rules_get (expect: rules array possibly empty)
- actual_rules_create (create test rule, requires existing payee/category) → Save rule ID
- actual_rules_update (use saved rule ID, modify conditions or actions)
- actual_rules_delete (use saved rule ID)

**Phase 6 - Transactions (11 tools):**
- actual_transactions_create (expense: -5000 cents in saved account) → Save transaction1 ID
- actual_transactions_create (income: 10000 cents in saved account) → Save transaction2 ID

- actual_transactions_search_by_amount (search for amounts around -5000 cents)
- actual_transactions_search_by_category (search using existing category)
- actual_transactions_search_by_month (search month: 2025-12)
- actual_transactions_search_by_payee (search using existing payee)
- actual_transactions_import (empty array - expect no-op success OR validation error, both acceptable)
- actual_transactions_delete (use saved transaction IDs)

**Phase 7 - Transaction Summaries (2 tools):**
- actual_transactions_summary_by_category
- actual_transactions_summary_by_payee

**Phase 8 - Budgets (9 tools):**
- actual_budgets_get_all (expect: budget data for all months)
- actual_budgets_getMonth (current month: 2025-12)
- actual_budgets_getMonths (get 3 months: 2025-10, 2025-11, 2025-12)

- actual_budgets_holdForNextMonth (hold 10000 cents for same category)
- actual_budgets_resetHold (reset the hold for same category)
- actual_budgets_transfer (transfer budget between two existing categories - create temp category if needed)
- actual_budgets_updates_batch (update multiple budgets at once using existing categories)

**Phase 9 - Advanced Query & Sync (2 tools):**
- actual_bank_sync (use saved account ID)
  * If no bank connection exists: Report "Skipped (no bank connection)" as ✓ success
  * Do NOT treat missing bank connection as failure
- actual_query_run - Test with these queries (if unsupported SQL features cause errors, report as ✓ informational):
  1. "SELECT COUNT(*) as total_transactions FROM transactions WHERE date >= '2025-01-01'" (simple count)
  2. "SELECT account, COUNT(*) as count, SUM(amount) as total FROM transactions GROUP BY account LIMIT 10" (basic aggregation)
  3. "SELECT payee, amount, date FROM transactions WHERE amount < 0 ORDER BY amount ASC LIMIT 5" (simple filter and sort)

**Phase 10 - Session Management (2 tools):**
- actual_session_list (expect: current session info with totalSessions, activeSessions, maxConcurrent)
- actual_session_close (optional sessionId parameter - test closing oldest idle session)
  * Note: May return error if only 1 active session (won't close current session)
  * If error about current session, report as ✓ informational (expected behavior)

**Phase 11 - Concurrency Test (ONLY if explicitly requested):**
- NOTE: By default, skip this phase and test sequentially
- If user requests concurrency testing, create 10 transactions simultaneously using actual_transactions_create
  * Use Promise.all() or make 10 rapid consecutive calls
  * Test different amounts: -1000, -2000, -3000, -4000, -5000, -6000, -7000, -8000, -9000, -10000 (cents)
  * All in the same test account
  * Verify all 10 were created successfully
  * This tests the write queue and concurrency handling

**Phase 12 - Cleanup (Non-Blocking):**
- Attempt to delete all test data created (accounts, categories, payees, transactions, rules)
- If a cleanup operation fails:
  * Report it as informational
  * Continue with remaining cleanup attempts
  * Do NOT mark overall test as failed
- Verify cleanup with list commands (expect test items removed)

**After completing all tests, provide:**
1. Total tools tested: X/51 (51 tools available)
2. Successful: X (✓)
3. Failed: X (✗) with error details
4. Informational: X (unsupported features, skipped operations)
5. Concurrency test result: Skipped (or Created X/10 transactions if requested)
6. Tools that might need special attention
7. Any patterns or issues observed
8. Complete list of all saved IDs for reference

**Output Format:**
Use this exact format for each tool:
[Phase X] tool_name — ✓ success
[Phase X] tool_name — ✗ failure: error message
[Phase X] tool_name — ℹ informational: reason

Ready? Start testing automatically with Phase 1, Tool 1: actual_server_info

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR TOOL EXECUTION:**
- You have direct access to 51 Actual Budget MCP tools via the MCP protocol
- DO NOT use actual_query_run to call other tools
- Call each tool directly using its proper MCP tool interface
- For example, to call actual_rules_help, invoke the MCP tool "actual_rules_help" with parameter {"topic": "all"}
- Each tool is a separate MCP tool that can be invoked directly
- The tools are NOT SQL queries - they are MCP protocol tools

**AUTOMATED TESTING MODE - NO INTERRUPTIONS:**
- This is an AUTOMATED test run - complete ALL 51 tools in one continuous session
- DO NOT STOP after successful tools - immediately proceed to the next tool
- DO NOT ask "Would you like me to continue?" - just continue
- DO NOT provide detailed explanations - just status lines and continue
- Test ONE tool at a time, wait for response, output status line, immediately test next tool
- ONLY STOP on failure (as defined in Failure Definition section)
- Your goal: test all 51 tools without any breaks or confirmations

**CRITICAL: STRICTLY SEQUENTIAL EXECUTION:**
- NEVER call multiple tools in parallel
- NEVER make concurrent tool requests
- ALWAYS wait for the previous tool to complete before calling the next one
- This is MANDATORY - parallel calls will cause server failures
- If you detect you're about to make parallel calls, STOP and do them one by one instead

**ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL - DO NOT SIMULATE:**
- DO NOT just write the output lines without calling tools
- DO NOT generate fake success messages
- You MUST actually invoke each MCP tool and wait for the real response
- Only report success/failure AFTER receiving the actual tool response
- If you find yourself writing "[Phase X] tool_name — ✓ success" without having called the tool, STOP
- Every status line MUST be based on an actual tool invocation and response

**START NOW: Actually invoke the MCP tool "actual_server_info" with no parameters and wait for the response before proceeding.**
